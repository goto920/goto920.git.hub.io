You do not have to read all.
I hope the basic operation is intuitive. 
Additional features are, however, not intuitive.

<H2>1. Basic operation</H2>

From top to bottom, left to right of the screen shot.

Note: Modification of patterns will take effect immediately.
So, in case modification during playback causes skip of notes
in the current bar (Stop and Start is safer).

<H3>Additional Feature Menus (at shown state)</H3>

<H2>3. SetLists creation and editing</H2>

Setlist is useful for a gig or practice session to review
the BPM of each song.
The "default" setlist will be automatically saved.
The "sample" setlist can be modified in the application but
cannot be saved.
You may add your own setlist with a new name based on the
gig or date.

<H3>Setlist example ("sample")</H3>

The "sample" setlist can be modified but cannot be saved.
The original "sample" setlist will be uploaded when you start the program. 
So, you can try playback, editing safely.

In case, you like automatic stop, use the Timer in the main menu.
</OL>

Note: Tempo(bpm) cannot be registered. All the bpm in the registered
patterns are set at playback with Basic operation.
Setting different bpm for each pattern in the loop table is not
possible.
Set the bpm for the loop with Basic Operation when you add the
loop to a songlist of a setlist.
