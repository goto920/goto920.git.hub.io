<H2>How to use</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Prepare audio stem files (separate files for vocal, bass, drums, etc...)
<UL>
<LI>Single file is fine, of course.
<LI>In any audio file formats which your browser can play. 
Typically wav, mp3, aac etc.
<LI>Sample audio (Song written and performed by the author of this page):
<A HREF="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11tRoLGjKvuE-qdSL8fpKrWCH5WT_uM0s?usp=sharing">Stem files</A>
</UL>
<LI>start the App by clicking the image (link).
<LI>Open stem audio files of single file and wait until loades.
<UL>
<LI>Local files or files, or 
<LI>files in your cloud drive where your browser can read.
</UL>
<LI>Adjust mix balance with "Channel Gain".<br />
(Adjust playback volume with Master Gain)
<LI>Play, Pause, Stop, Repeat with Player controls and Speed/Pitch controls.
<UL>
<LI>Only slowing down (&le; 100 %) works for realtime playback.
<LI>For &gt; 100, use export.
</UL>
<LI>Export file will be filename mix-utctime.wav.
<UL>
<LI>Processing time is within 30 seconds (depends on the device used).
<LI>Save the exported file and playback with an audio player.
<LI>Downloading the exported file on Mobile Safari requires special 
operation. See the note below
</UL>
</OL>

<H3>Note on iOS12</H3>

My iPhone/iPod Touch (iOS12) requires special operation to store the 
exported data. 
Blob window pops up and it is possible to save the data 
on iCloud Drive. 
You want to rename the file with extension".wav", 
because the filename will not be set automatically. 
The problem of the specification might be solved already 
on iOS 13. 
Note iOS 13 does not support older devices such as my iPod Touch and iPhone6.
